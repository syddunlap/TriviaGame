# TriviaGame

A TriviaGame about Sailing. 

There is a timer on each question and if the time runs out before an answer is clicked, the user gets the question incorrect.

If the user guesses correctly, they get a point added to their score.

When the quiz is over, a final score screen appears with a restart button, as well.

This game was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.
